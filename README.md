moztest-syntax-highlighting
===========================

Mozilla test log syntax highlighting for Sublime Text 3.


##Installation

 1. In Sublime Text 3 click "Preferences" > "Browse Packages..."
 2. Copy MozillaTest.tmLanguage into that folder and you are done.

This syntax highlighting will be applied to *.test. If your test logs do not have this extension simply change the syntax to "Mozilla Test Output."

If you want to change any colors e.g. support.function.dom.js then:

 1. Move the cursor to a word that is in the color you like in your current theme such as a keyword.
 2. Press ctrl + shift + P to display the color
 3. Any identifiers assigned to that keyword will be displayed in your sublime status bar for a second or two.
